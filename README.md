# The-Goblin-Hunt-A-DnD5e-Homebrew-Compendium
## 📓 D&D 5E Online Compendium 📓

Welcome to the **D&D 5E Online Compendium**, a GitHub Pages-hosted tool for players, Dungeon Masters, and creators who want an accessible, visually rich, and modular collection of one-shots, class abilities, custom items, and monsters.

### 🧩 What’s Inside

This compendium hosts a series of **One-Shot Adventures** designed to be flexible for new players and adaptable to varied timelines. Inside, you’ll find:

- 🗺️ **Locations, maps, and narrative descriptions**
- 🧙‍♂️ **Character class skill trees**, ideal for visualizing progression
- 🃏 **Virtual playing cards** representing abilities, items, and monsters
- 📖 A growing library of lore and modular game elements
- 🧑‍🎨 Homebrew content that supports both low-prep DMs and creative worldbuilders

## 🌍 The World

The first featured campaign, **Goblin Hunt**, serves as a pilot D&D 5E one-shot in a rich, original setting:

> A gritty, low-magic, high-lore continent where lost ruins breathe old magic and forgotten gods linger beneath the soil. The Goblin Hunt leads players through hostile forests, tribal politics, and cursed relics.
